# Business-Task-Manager

## Description

Transitioning toward back end programming and the logical step would be to dip our toes in with Express.js before making the full leap into database-building. Using Express and the file system to act as a stand-in database, I was tasked with building out a task management/ note taking application that will take in new tasks, save them, retrieve them as needed, and for this data to be persistent.
